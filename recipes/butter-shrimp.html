        <p>Homemade Cajun seasoning and butter are the main stars in this simple dish. Serve with rice or grits drizzled with the pan sauce, or serve as an appetizer. Also delicious tossed with buttered noodles</p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>1 package cheddar biscuit mix (such as Red Lobster™ Cheddar Bay Biscuit® Mix)</li>
            <li>2 cups whole buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish with butter.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in an even layer on bottom of baking dish. Stir together buttermilk, Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix, and included spice packet in a large bowl until combined. Pour evenly on top of the chicken (do not mix to combine). Top evenly with mixed vegetables.</li>
