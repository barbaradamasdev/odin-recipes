        <p>This easy casserole takes the flavors of chicken pot pie but instead of encasing it in pie crust it's topped with Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits. It's prepared just like a dump cake — no stirring needed!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>1 package cheddar biscuit mix (such as Red Lobster™ Cheddar Bay Biscuit® Mix)</li>
            <li>2 cups whole buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat extra virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, red pepper, celery, and a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add capers; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Stir salmon, onion mixture, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, garlic, mustard, cayenne, seafood seasoning, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl until well-mixed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firmed and chilled, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Form salmon mixture into four 1-inch thick patties; sprinkle remaining panko bread crumbs over each patty.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook patties in hot oil until golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
